# jtb

JTB is a syntax tree builder to be used with the Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC) parser generator. 
JTB was originally developped at UCLA up to version 1.3.2 (http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/) or (http://compilers.cs.ucla.edu/jtb/jtb-2003/).
It has been upgraded in version 1.4.0+ (2009-2010), as an embedded tool within the SourceForge Eclipse JavaCC plugin. 
From 2011 to 2016 it was provided as a standalone tool in the same hosting environment as JavaCC (java.net), which closed.
Since 2017 it is provided as a standalone tool in the same new hosting environment as JavaCC (https://github.com/jtb-javacc/JTB).
