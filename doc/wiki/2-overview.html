<h2>Overview</h2>
<font color="red">JTB</font> (Java Tree Builder) is a syntax tree builder and visitors generator to be used
 in front of <a href="http://javacc.org">JavaCC (Java Compiler Compiler)</a>.<br>

It takes a JavaCC grammar file as input (you just have to change the extension from
 "<font color="red">.jj</font>" to "<font color="red">.jtb</font>" and add a few options) and it automatically
 generates the following:
<ul>
<li>a set of syntax tree classes based on the productions in the grammar,
 utilizing the Visitor design pattern;</li>
<li>four interfaces: <font color="red">IVoidVisitor</font>, <font color="red">IVoidArguVisitor</font>,
 <font color="red">IRetVisitor</font>, <font color="red">IRetArguVisitor</font>;</li>
<li>four depth-first visitors: <font color="red">DepthFirstVoidVisitor</font>,
 <font color="red">DepthFirstVoidArguVisitor</font>,
 <font color="red">DepthFirstRetVisitor</font>, <font color="red">DepthFirstRetArguVisitor</font>,
 whose default methods simply visit the children of the current node;</li>
<li>a JavaCC grammar "<font color="red">.jj</font>" file (<font color="red">jtb.out.jj</font> by default),
 with the proper annotations to build the syntax tree during parsing (which then must be compiled with JavaCC).</li>
</ul>

New visitors, which subclass any generated one, can then override the default methods and perform various
 operations on and manipulate the generated syntax tree.<p>
 
JTB can be compared to JJTree in the following way:<ul>
<li>in JJTree you explicitly define the nodes you want to build; in JTB it builds by default all of them
 (but you can tell not to build some of them),</li>
<li>JJTree generates only interfaces for visitors and you have to code the visitors, so you "fill" them;
 JTB generates interfaces and "full" visitors (i.e. with all the code to visit the tree), so you just
 "modify" them, sometimes just "reducing" them (for not visiting branches), so in a sense it is faster to
 develop on an already generated - bullet proof - code,</li>
<li>in JJTree, you are tempted to tune the tree, i.e. define only the nodes you need, but if you want to
 develop different visitors, you have to think about all the nodes you want to traverse for the different
 purposes and so you may find yourself sometimes having to enrich the grammar and  defeat what you have
 previously done; in JTB you have all the tree right from the beginning so adding a new visitor is not
 disruptive,</li>
 <li>JTB can "inline" the accept methods, i.e. it generates for a node the code to work directly on its
 children, which is usually the right place to take decisions and to reduce the control logic (otherwise
 you usually have to access the fathers and check their types),</li>
<li>JJTree may be more adequate when only small trees and few visitors are needed; JTB may be more adequate
 when you have to work on the entire tree and build many visitors.</li>
</ul>
